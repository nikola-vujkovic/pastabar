# Pastabar Pahuljica (featuring GitHub Pages)
Beta website of Pastabar Pahuljica!
This repository was supposed to be a website for a pastabar, before the project was cancelled.

Right now, this is just a demo of using GitHub Pages to display a React website.

Running NPM DEPLOY in VSCode deploys the current project state to GitHub Pages within minutes.
